# Description 

Rewriting ASCII Generator using Flask because it turns out there's less boiletplate code, which == less files to submit üëç

The final project for my university Python class, this is a simple webpage powered by ~~Beaker~~ Flask.

The frontend is a simple form with a text field and a submit button, the latter of which calls an API endpoint to display an ASCII art representation of what the user (probably you) typed. Just like ‚ú® magic ‚ú®

# Setup

## With MySQL and Python:

To install the Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the Flask app:
```
flask --app app run
```

The app will now be accessible on http://localhost:5000.

## With Docker:

```
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

This will set up MySQL for you, as well as phpMyAdmin for a GUI that you can view the database with (on http://localhost:8080).
